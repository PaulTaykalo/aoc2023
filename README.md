Advent of Code Solutions in 2023

This is a repository for my solutions to the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) challenges in 2023.

## Usage

Most of the solutions are `.swift` files with main method, so you can run them with `swift` command.

Some solutions had a few different, not really working implementations, so basically the last one is the working one.

## For the future me

- [ ] Prepare a template for the solutions
- [ ] Add helper structures for parsing input
- [ ] Allow each solutions to reuse the helpers. so they'll won't be copied over and over again
- [ ] Consider using SPM for the solutions
- [ ] Prepare VSCode for the better experience (syntax highlighting, etc.)
